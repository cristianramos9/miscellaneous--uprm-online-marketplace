I completed Task 1: Project Structure Setup by creating the necessary folders and files for the project. The src/ directory now includes components/, styles/, and images/ to keep the project organized. Additionally, index.html has been added as the main entry point. With this setup in place, the team can now proceed with the next tasks following the established priority order.
